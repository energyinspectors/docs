ei-questions

1.  Solutions subnav menu options different from actual sections on the solutions page, need to reconcile

2.  Do you have a Google Analytics account?  I started to create one, but found that both ei@gmail.com and energyinspectors@gmail.com were already taken.  If you own either, we can use them to create a GA account.

3.  Since you're adding social media icons to the new site, you should grab the name "energyinspectors" at Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn.
